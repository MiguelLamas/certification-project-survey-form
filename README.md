# certification-project-survey-form

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

This is 1 of the 5 require projects to earn (New) Responsive Web Design certification.

For this project, I built a Survey Form using HTML and CSS to collect data from users.
